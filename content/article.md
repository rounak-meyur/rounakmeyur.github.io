It was Fall had arrived amidst this pandemic and it would have been a pity to miss out on a bike ride through the colorful forests.

## The Plan
The idea of a road biking trip had always been on my mind. And with my dear friend and road biking companion Arindam's agreement to the idea, we wanted to do something big. The dilemma, as always, was about the location and the duration of our "biking trip" (if you wanna call it so). You see, I stay in Charlottesville, Virginia and Arindam in Chicago, Illinois. We needed to choose a location which is far away from both of us - a place where we can't go for a biking activity any random day. And what other place to visit during the Fall than the colorful New England.

Obviously the "Work From Home" made things a little bit easier for both of us.

And thus began my long drive through the north-eastern states until we reach Vermont.
